    %"OoOoh?" the thug's head tilts to a side. "So you here to score some guns... crank......... crack!" his eyes flash wide over a smile. "Naah, mommy wouldn't do ~that~... " he says, leaning over to try and tickle Dottie's cheek, where it meets the neck.

His cheeks grew round from a smile "Where folk go missing lest they belong.. " and his eyes fall to Dottie, lines forming under the eyes before he looked to Laura again. A silent question can be seen on his face, along the lines of ~Why on earth do you wanna go there, woman?~. He looks almost concerned.
