    %"...So... things aren't looking very rosy in The Projects. Not enough medical personnel, not enough supplies. People are worn out thin and sick as fuck!" he wags his head, wide-eyed.

    %"But that's not why they threw you out, eh?" she walks alongside him, studying his face. Her expression is mostly flat.

    %"No ... it's not ... " he still walks, looking to the ground, immersed in thought "... but it's good that they did.

        %"Excuse him... " she looks back to Laura and Dottie as they went past. "He's a bit upset... having lost his ... privileges... "

        %"I'm not upset!!" he keeps on walking, the voice fading "I'm not ... " burying his face in his palms "Oh god.. what am I gonna do here... " his voice fades as looks about the square in despair.    
    ->"....." she says nothing, getting out of their path.
