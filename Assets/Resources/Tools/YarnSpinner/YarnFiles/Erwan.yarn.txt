->“Gotten yourself into any trouble lately?” Laura smiles teasingly.
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Erwan>>
    %“Heh. Not at all. I caught that no-good ‘Snake’ guy creeping around outside here, though. Made sure he knew he isn’t welcome here.”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
    ¤“Really? When?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Erwan>>
    %“Few hours ago. You in any trouble?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
    ->“No, no. It’s nothing. Do you know where he hangs out, though?”
        <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Erwan>>
        %“Hm.” Erwan studies Laura with hesitation. “His kind hangs out to the north of here, but you probably already knew that. That’s no place for a honest guy to be”.

        ¤“Don’t worry. I can take care of myself. Thanks!”

    ->“Not at all. No worries.”
