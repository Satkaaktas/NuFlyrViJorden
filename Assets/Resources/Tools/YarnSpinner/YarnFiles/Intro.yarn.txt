%"Hello Laura, Dottie. May I come in?"
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>> 
¤"Norbert. Of course, come in!" Laura is quickly roused from her rumination.
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Dottie>>
%"Hi Norb!" Dottie looks up at Norbert and greets him with a nod and then quickly switches her attention back to the toy.
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
¤"What can I do for you?" Laura takes a few steps toward Norbert as he comes in.
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
%“I know things seem tough right now but if you need anything I’m here for you. We all are.” Norbert pauses, collecting his thoughts. “You know, I was thinking about what Jeb said and I had this idea… Maybe you could talk to Bobby, maybe he could help?"
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
¤“Bobby? What? No… not after that thing with Kaleb.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Dottie>>
%“Look what Jeb got me!” Dottie proudly presents the toy that Jeb gave her yesterday, now reduced to a mockery of its former self. “Look!”
<<ChangePortait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
“That’s great Dottie.” Norbert gives her a pleasant smile. “Laura, that was such a long time ago. I’m sure Bobby is over that!” Norbert smiles reassuringly. “I actually saw him at the gates earlier. You should go talk to him.”
->"I'd rather not..."
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
    ¤“The thing with Bobby… It didn’t end well. It’s better if I just let him be.” Laura is silent for a moment. “Jeb told me he knew someone in AlphaAid that could help me. He just need time to set it up.” Laura pauses and bites her lower lip. “He was going to contact me today but… I just haven’t heard anything from him. I guess I… I lashed out at him yesterday.”
->"Maybe you're right."
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
    ¤“You think he can get me through the checkpoint? I don’t know why he would want to though…”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
    %“Bobby is a good lad! Don’t worry. He’ll be thrilled to see you!”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
    ¤“Well, we’ll see.” Laura pauses and bites her lower lip. “Jeb told me he knew someone in AlphaAid who could help me. He just needs time to set it up.” Laura pauses and bites her lower lip. “He was going to contact me today but… I just haven’t heard anything from him. I guess I… I lashed out at him yesterday.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
%“Well, Jeb seems a bit touchy about the past.” Norbert’s smile wanes. “I’m sure he has his reasons. Anyway, I think Bobby is your best bet. I don’t know how much sway he has with the enforcers at the checkpoint but I’m sure he’ll do anything to help an old friend out.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Dottie>>
“Hey! I wanna go to the checkpoint! I saw this big truck and they hand out all kinds of stuff! Can we go? Can we?”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
“Oh, I saw that too. That’s the Paragon Foundation van.” Norbert turns to Laura with a frown on his face. “Remember that they are the ones working on the genome project who put us in this mess to begin with!” His face softens as he collects his thoughts. “They started some new project. No clue what’s it for. I’m not sure they could help. I wouldn’t trust them one bit if I were you.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
¤“I guess I could see what’s going on at least… I need to discern all my options.” A determined look forms upon her face. “I’ll do anything necessary. Legal, illegal or in-between doesn’t matter!”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
%“Well don’t even think of getting involved with the wrong crowd! The streets are rife with opportunist scum just looking for people in a pinch to squeeze dry. They use you just as much as they use the system!”

%“Whatever you do I’m sure you’ll make the right choices.”
Norbert gives you a comforting smile, but the concern in his eyes is obvious.

¤“I actually know a guy and if he can do anything to help me I couldn’t care any less about what he does for a living!” Laura sighs. “Don’t worry, Norbert. I can take care of myself, and I would never put Dottie in harm’s way.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait Norbert>>
%“Oh, is that so? Its Carl isn’t it? I knew he was up to no good!” Norbert expression is a mix of resentment and fear.
<<ChangePortrait Portrait Laura>>
¤“What? No, of course not! Carl is like… twelve years old!” Laura gives Norbert a reassuring smile. “Don’t worry it’s no one from this place. He goes by the name ‘Snake’. Some outsider, totally non-threatening. I’ll stay out of trouble. I promise!”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait Norbert>>
%“Well… Just promise me you go see Bobby and don’t do anything stupid.” Norbert lets out a deep sigh. “Whatever you do I’m sure you’ll make the right choices.” Norbert gives you a comforting smile, but the concern in his eyes is obvious.
