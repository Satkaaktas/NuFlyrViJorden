%"...So... things aren't looking very rosy in The Projects. Not enough medical personnel, not enough supplies. People are worn out thin and sick as fuck!" he wags his head, wide-eyed.
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Aquaintence>>
%"But that's not why they threw you out, eh?" she walks alongside him, studying his face. Her expression is mostly flat.
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Exiled>>
%"No ... it's not ... " he still walks, looking to the ground, immersed in thought "... but it's good that they did. At least out here I can fend for myself... instead of waiting for them to provide the bare necessities. D'you know how many people I've seen coughing their lungs out?" he raised his brows to her, before turning to Laura as she was in their path. 
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
->"Guess it's all the same, more or less... unless you're in the inner circles.. " she pauses, eying both interlocutors.
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Exiled>>
    %"The fuck are you?" he says with a dire frown. "Git outta my face!" waving a hand upward dismissively, almost hitting her as it flew by her nose. 
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Aquaintence>>
    %"Excuse him... " she looks back to Laura and Dottie as they went past. "He's a bit upset... having lost his ... privileges... " 
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Exiled>>
    %"I'm not upset!!" he keeps on walking, the voice fading "I'm not ... " burying his face in his palms "Oh god.. what am I gonna do here... " his voice fades as looks about the square in despair.    
->"....." she says nothing, getting out of their path.

%She hops in place, somewhere in between being neurotic and ecstatic "I know it's gonna be right this time! I know it has to be right... They can't make the same mistake twice!" 
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Patient2>>
%She just stood there, watching her with a dullness about her facial features. 
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Patient1>>
%"They're gonna hand me the test... and it will say: "This is your ticket, honey. Come join us where you belong. Come and leave this ... " she looks to the side, sadness and angst creeping up on her face ".. hellhole behind. This cesspool of mankind.. " her voice fades in favour of troubling thoughts. 
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Patient2>>
%"Ssuuuuure they are, love... sssuuure they are... " the apathetic one replies, just watching her interlocutor, soaking in her every move and expression as her own remains unchanged. 
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
Â¤"....." she stood in place, not feeling a need to inquire about anything nor interject, before moving on.

%"I need some juice... some... " he bends over, leaning on his knees and starts coughing, clearing his throat harshly, loudly. The substance he expelled was thick and gooey, almost black. "Some juice... to get me through the day. To make me well again... " he lifts the head, looking at the queue before him, frowning.

%"Antioxidants are rationed both according to need and supply" he recites in a monotone voice, as if repeating it for the hundredth time. "If you've received your weekly rations, additional dosage can not and will not be administered" his eyes remain fixed on the lamenting one, a slightly troubled frown breaking through the deadpan expression.
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Patient3>>
%"But what am I supposed to do?!" he cries out, spreading his arms, showing palms. "Go out and find some bloody berries...?" he shook his head, in visible and audible despair. "The mosquitoes will eat me alive!" 
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_MedicalPersonnel>>
%"Go out and find some bl. .  some berries..... yes" he confirms and nods, barely. 
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Patient3>>
%He stood there for a long moment until a primal cry starts to build in his throat, in his broken lungs. "...aAaAAaaARRrRRgGGHH!!!" with newfound strength he pushed the nearest person in queue and ran off, away from the crowds. 
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
->"Is there really no way to help these people?" she looked to the young man in a dusty white lab coat. "Can you not synthesize enough? Do you lack raw materials? This can't be the case.. " she shook her head.
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_MedicalPersonnel>>
    %"We need more of the appropriate biomatter to coat the chemicals with. They cannot be absorbed otherwise. The body cannot use them.. " his head slowly turns to Laura, it seems like he is reciting, repeating yet again. 
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
    ->"I have some alg.... hh h sh .. stored away... " most of the sentence is inaudible and her voice fades away as she recalls she has other, pressing matters to attend to. After a short pause of peering at the dust on the ground, she lifts her gaze. "I .. I see.." and shrugs lightly, moving on, immersed in thought.
    ->"I seeee... " she stood there for a long moment, with her mouth ajar. "Oh well.. " she shrugs lightly and moves on.
->She said nothing and went about her business.
