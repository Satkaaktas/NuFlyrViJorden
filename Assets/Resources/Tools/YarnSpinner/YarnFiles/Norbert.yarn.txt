->“What makes you think Bobby is willing to help?”

    %“He is a good lad, he will do what is right! Besides, he really likes you, even now. I´m sure of it!”

    ¤“I´m not to sure. But how do you suppose he could get me through the checkpoint?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
    %“Well, he is stationed there. I´m sure he knows someone who can help if he can´t get you through himself. I think it´s your best bet.”

    ->“Maybe you are right. There was something else I wanted to ask you.”

    ->“Ok. I better be going.”
->“Do you know anything more about the med-van and what's going on at the square?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
    %“They started something new. Handing out stuff for free, pretending to care. I wouldn’t bother. They don’t care about any of us regular folk.” Norbert let’s out a deep sigh. “I heard Tammy and Sam talking about it though. Maybe they know more.”

    ->“I see. There was something else I wanted to ask you.”

    ->“Ok. I better be going.”
->“Aren´t the smugglers getting through the checkpoint?”
    <<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Norbert>>
    %“Yeah, well... probably! But don’t you get mixed up with them! It will only make things worse. They are not willing to do any charity work.”
    ->“Don’t worry. I can take care of myself. There was something else I wanted to ask you.”
