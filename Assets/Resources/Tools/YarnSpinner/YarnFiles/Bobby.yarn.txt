    %Bobby scans the district with a bored gaze, arms crossed. Brightens up when he notices Laura and opens up his arms for a bear hug. 
    "Laura! Long time no see. Still working with Norbert?”

%Bobby steps closer. As his arms wrap around Laura, he doesn't notice Laura trying to resist the hug. “You always smell of dirt and the sea. I like that about you…”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
¤Laura hides her discomfort by speaking into Bobby's uniform. “I need your help Bob. I’m all alone. They are forcing me and Dottie apart! I have been chosen by the MSA but… she… Didn't…“
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Bobby>>
%As the words leave Laura's lips, Bobby stiffens and takes a step backwards, releasing her. He watches Dottie play with the other children at the square. ”His offspring wasn't good enough for MSA huh? Who would have guessed... Go to your Hovel friends Laura, you choose them over the Projects, over Me. You are not alone. You won't fool me twice.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
¤“I'm Sorry... I'm really sorry Bob, okay? I understand that you don't want anything to do with me after what happened.” Laura turns around gesturing towards the children chasing a toy between the lines. “But think about Dottie. Don't let her suffer for something I did! She didn't choose this world.”

%Bobby shuffles his boots uncomfortably and avoids looking directly at Laura. “... Thanks. This job sure has its perks. So, what brings you to District Square today, surely not to fool around with some Enforcer? I ain't that dumb anymore.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Laura>>
[[“Sorry Bob, I… I never meant to hurt you. I'm really sorry things turned out the way they did. Anyway, I had a fight with Jeb again and need to sort things out. I need your help to get into the Projects.”|Bobby_Sorry]]
[[“Haha, c'mon Bob!” Laura bursts out while teasingly throwing a jab at his shoulder. “ Who wouldn't want to fool around with someone like you.”|Bobby_Haha]]

%Bobby's tone has changed as he responds: “Oh, now you're sorry?” He pauses, checking his gun. “Well, I don't do charity, and I sure won't do anything for old times sake. But there is one thing you can help me with first. My boss ain't happy about how the smugglers are gaining influence in the Projects. Drugs show up in the wrong places. You get me the name of their distribution leader, then I'll help you with whatever you need.”

%Bobby straightens and gives Laura a stern look. “You wouldn't.” Bobby looks at the citizens of the hovel. “You chose him, the charming farmer boy, and look where that got you. A lone mother with the burden of supporting a child in these dirty Slums! Stop this nonsense... you made your choice years ago.”
<<ChangePortrait Portrait UI_Portrait_Bobby>>
-> “... You're right. I went out of line. I'm sorry. My daughter needs your help. Please don't let Dottie suffer in my place. You have all the right to be mad at me. But not her, she never choose this. I did. Please help her.”

%Bobby stands silent a while, watching the children argue as the toy breaks after hitting the Projects wall. With a sigh he shifts his gaze back to Laura. “Fine! God damnit! Fuck you Laura. You always knew which buttons to push... I’ll help you. But I'm not leaving empty handed this time. I’ll need something from you first. My superiors are unhappy about the smugglers advances and the investigation is going slowly. With your way around people I'm sure you can get me the name of their distribution leader.”
